📌 Project Overview
Voicify is an AI-powered application designed to assist mute individuals in communicating effortlessly with the rest of the world.
It uses real-time hand gesture recognition to interpret sign language through camera input, converts it into English text, and then translates the text into the user’s preferred language using Google Text-to-Speech (GTTS). 
Finally, it generates speech output, enabling smooth and effective communication.

🚀 Key Features
✔ Real-Time Sign Language Recognition – Uses an AI model to recognize hand gestures and translate them into text.
✔ Multi-Language Translation – Converts the recognized text into the user’s preferred language using Google Translate.
✔ Text-to-Speech Conversion – Uses GTTS to generate natural-sounding speech output.
✔ User-Friendly GUI – A graphical interface to simplify interactions, making it easy to use for everyone.
✔ Seamless Integration – Combines AI, translation, and speech generation into a single, efficient pipeline.

⚙️ How It Works
1️⃣ User performs sign language gestures in front of the camera.
2️⃣ AI model processes the gestures and converts them into English text.
3️⃣ The English text is translated into the user’s preferred language.
4️⃣ The translated text is converted into speech using GTTS.
5️⃣ The final audio output is played, allowing easy communication.
